# Bird Species Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect and classify bird species from images using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to accurately identify various bird species based on the visual characteristics present in the images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of bird images labeled with their respective species. Each image is annotated with metadata such as species name, location, and possibly other relevant attributes.

## Methodology

- **Image Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed to standardize size, normalize colors, and enhance features for better model performance.
  
- **Model Selection**: Various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in bird species classification.

- **Training**: The selected model is trained on a portion of the dataset, optimizing for accuracy and generalization.

- **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance in terms of classification accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Implementation

- **Main Script**: The main script (`main.py` or similar) contains the pipeline for training and testing the model.
  
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks (`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`, `model_training.ipynb`) detailing data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-species-detection.git
   cd bird-species-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure Python 3.x and required libraries are installed.

3. **Run the Project**:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Follow instructions in the script to train the model and/or make predictions.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The achieved accuracy of the model on the test set.
- **Visualization**: Visual representations of model predictions and performance metrics.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate transfer learning for improved model performance.
- Expand dataset to include more diverse bird species and variations.
- Deploy the model as a web application or mobile app for real-time bird species identification.
